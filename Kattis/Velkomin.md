# Welcome Message for Forritunarkeppni Framhaldsskólanna 2021

## Problem Statement  
The Forritunarkeppni Framhaldsskólanna programming contest welcomes participants in 2021.  
To greet everyone, we need to print a welcome message.

### Task  
Write a program that prints the following message exactly as shown: ``VELKOMIN!``

### Input  
There is no input for this problem.

### Output  
Print a single line containing: ``VELKOMIN!``

## Solution Approach  
1. Since there is no input, the program only needs to output a fixed string.  
2. A single print statement is sufficient to generate the required output.  
3. Ensure that the output exactly matches the given text, including capitalization and punctuation.

## Solution in C  
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("VELKOMIN!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
## Solution in Python

print("VELKOMIN!")
```
